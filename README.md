## About Me ðŸ”­

I'm passionate about technology and have been immersed in the tech world for the past 7 years. My journey has taken me through various roles, from building technical teams for the likes of Meta, Revolut and more, to program management at McLaren Racing and collaborating with Google and the Mayor of London on STEM and creative design initiatives.

## My Journey into Coding ðŸŒ±

Despite a fulfilling career in recruiting and program management, I found myself intrigued and somewhat envious of the learning opportunities my scholars had in coding. So, I decided to dive into Python and explore the world of programming myself.

## What You'll Find Here ðŸ¤”

On my GitHub profile, you'll discover my venture into the realm of coding. I aim to document my progress with the Python program at HyperionDev, and maybe even showcase a few side projects that ignite my passion.

## Get in Touch ðŸ“«

I'm always eager to connect with fellow tech enthusiasts, beginners, and seasoned professionals alike. Whether you have questions, feedback, or just want to chat about all things tech, feel free to reach out!
